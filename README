VCFloat requires Coq 8.5beta2.


VCFloat depends on the following further external libraries, which are
automatically downloaded from their official sources and built during
VCFloat's building process:

- Reservoir Labs Inc. R-CoqLib version 1.0 (from Reservoir Labs'
  GitHub at http://github.com/reservoirlabs/rcoqlib )

- CompCert 2.4 (from AbsInt's GitHub at
  https://github.com/AbsInt/CompCert.git , commit 5dd15440). VCFloat
  contains a patch from this commit (patches/compcert.patch),
  distributed under the GNU General Public License, version 3.0 or (at
  your option) any later version.

- Ssreflect 1.5 (from its official website at
  http://ssr.msr-inria.inria.fr/FTP/ssreflect-1.5.coq85beta2.tar.gz )

- Mathematical Components (MathComp) 1.5 (from its official website at
  http://ssr.msr-inria.inria.fr/FTP/mathcomp-1.5.coq85beta2.tar.gz )

- Flocq 2.4.0 (from INRIA GForge at
  https://gforge.inria.fr/git/flocq/flocq.git , commit bcbcde24)

- Coq-Interval 2.0.0 (from INRIA GForge at
  https://scm.gforge.inria.fr/anonscm/git/coq-interval/coq-interval.git
  , commit 81f1f918). VCFloat contains a patch from this commit
  (patches/interval.patch), distributed under CeCILL-C, version 1.0.

See ACKS for copyright and licensing information about those external
libraries.


Usage: assuming that you already have a standard installation of Coq
8.5beta2, GNU make, GNU autoconf, GNU automake, and git.

  0. Fetch the external libraries mentioned above, by running the
     following automatic script:

     ./get_external_libs.sh

     You can provide any further options that you want passed to the
     `make' commands for Ssreflect and MathComp (e.g. -j)

  1. Configure, by:

     ./configure

  2. Build, by:

     make

  After building, you do not need to move the files anywhere else
  (and, by the way, `make install' does not work). The build system
  automatically generates a ./run-coqide.sh script to edit the sources
  with CoqIDE (if installed on your system), as well as local load
  path configuration files for Emacs+ProofGeneral (if installed on
  your system). If you want to compile code against VCFloat, you can
  have a look at the autogenerated `coqopts' file, to grab the load
  path options to pass to Coq and its relevant tools (coqc,
  coq_makefile, etc.)
