THE CORE OF VCFLOAT

The core definitions and theorems are in:
 vcfloat/FPCore.v  -- definitions of basic types
 vcfloat/FPLang.v  -- deep-embedded description langage and rndval_with_cond theory
 vcfloat/FPLangOpt.v -- transformations on deep-embedded expressions

APPLICATION STYLE "Clight"
 VCFloat 1.0 was designed for use on CompCert Clight expression trees,
 as described in Ramananandro et al.  These files have been updated
 to latest versions of CompCert, Coq, and FPLang; they build in Coq
 but have not been tested.

 FILES: vcfloat/FPSolve.v,  vcfloat/cverif/*.v

APPLICATION STYLE "ftype"
 VCFloat 2.0 supports in addition a use case independent of CompCert Clight.
 One starts with a shallow-embedded floating-point expression,
 using the ordinary operators of Floqc (Binary.Bmult, Binary.Bplus, etc)
 but wrapped in special Coq definitions.


 FILES: vcfloat/Automate.v, vcfloat/Test.v

 See Test.v for an explanation of how to use VCFloat in this style.

------------------------- Requirements Notes -------------------------

VCFloat depends on Coq's Flocq and Interval packages.

See coq-vcfloat.opam to see which versions of Coq, coq-flocq, and coq-interval are needed.


To install:

Use the Coq Platform (https://github.com/coq/platform)
to ensure that Coq has access to all the above-named packages.
Very possibly, by early 2024 coq-vcfloat will be included in the Coq platform.

If vcfloat is not already in the Coq Platform, then install the Coq platform, then:
 1. cd into the vcfloat/vcfloat directory
 2. make depend
 3. make
 4. make install
