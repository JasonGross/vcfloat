(* The following RtoFloat tactics are a very crude way to convert a n
  expression of type R that uses only IZR, Rplus, Rmult, Rdiv, Rinv,
  to a primitive floating-point constant.  It's crude in part because
  it always uses rounding-UP, which is not really appropriate, and it'
 does not use interval arithmetic.   It could perhaps be improved to actually
 compute in interval arithmetic, etc.

  Usage:  
  RtoFloat' x    returns a float-valued expression corresponding
                                  to the real-valued expression
  RtoFloat x    returns a float-valued constant from the real-valued expr
  ShowBound  prints it out with its name.
